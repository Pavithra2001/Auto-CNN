# Auto-CNN

Auto-CNN is an automatic CNN architecture design method by using genetic algorithms, to effectively address the image classification tasks. To use Auto-CNN, users do not need domain knowledge of CNNs , while they can still obtain a promising CNN architecture for the given images. The algorithm is validated on widely used benchmark image classification datasets. The experimental results indicate the algorithm outperforms the existing automatic CNN architecture design algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, parameter numbers and consumed computational resources. The algorithm also shows the very comparable classification accuracy to the best one from manually-designed and automatic+manually tuning CNNs, while consumes much less of computational resource. This is implemented based on the paper: Automatically Designing CNN Architectures Using Genetic Algorithm for Image Classification
